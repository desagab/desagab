# Hi there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gabriele and I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Graduate at Politecnico di Milano. I graduated in April 2024 with a **Master's Thesis** about Defect Detection called "Implementing cardboard crease detection in high-speed manufacturing through deep learning". In the last two years, I worked as a **Research Fellow** on a research project regarding Industry 4.0 at Sapienza University of Rome, specializing in **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**.   

Currently, I work as Software Engineer at Satispay.
